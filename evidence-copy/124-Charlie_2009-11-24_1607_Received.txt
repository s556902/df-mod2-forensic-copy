Charlie, Jo,
 
   great news - we got another contract.  I need to have one (or both) of you start looking into quantum cryptography - anything and everything patented on the subject.  If you get bored over the short vacation start having a look at it.  This is with a new company, so let's impress them !
 
Thanks
Pat
