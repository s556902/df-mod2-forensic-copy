Dear Team,
 
   today's the first day - do what you need to do, getting your office set up or what not.  But normally we will observe a common workday, with 12-1 PM being the designated lunch time.  I do not see any reason why anyone should deviate from this schedule in the future.
   I tried the place across the street recently, it's pretty good.  Perhaps once a week or so we could all try to have lunch together.
 
Regards,
 
Pat
