Dear Pat,

Yes, we are very interested in using your prior art investigation services. Our R&D department is currently applying for patents in two key areas that we are counting on to gain market share over our major competitor, project2400.com. I am counting on you and your firm to keep these research areas in strict confidentiality. We wouldn't want project2400 to know about our research interests.

We will hire you to do prior art searches on these two areas:

    * Time machines
    * Teleporters

Please send me a quote for these two investigations.

Regards,

Alex
