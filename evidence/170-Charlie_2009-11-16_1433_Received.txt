Charlie,
 
   just curious if you have had a chance to try the food at the place across the street.  I went there today; first time I have ever had abalone.  I think I should like to try to make that at home when of these days, but I think it involves a lot of pounding.  We should all try that place - perhaps Fridays we could have team meetings during lunch.
