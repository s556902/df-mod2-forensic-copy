Normal coffee works for me.  Nothing special.
 
Thanks,

    Charlie, Terry,
     
        just checking up on your preferences for coffee - jo is going shopping tomorrow, let us know what you want.
     
    Jo, I like my coffee cinnamon apple flavor with just a whisper of cream - be sure to get the heavy whipping cream, NOT the half and half.  See if they have any of those nice pumpkin muffins, too.
